# bibtex-parser
simple bibtex-parser

Simple bibtex-parser used to extract bibliography from \*.bib files.
The output will be a dictionary with ID as key, title as content.






This project is initialized for migrating my endnote-exported bib file to zotero-exported bib file.
Endnote export IDs start with RN (e.g., RN2322), while zotero use a much better way for ID generation (e.g., author_title_year}.
